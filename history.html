    <h1>History of Wrocław</h1>
    <p>
        Wrocław’s history stretches back over a thousand years, shaped by various empires and cultures.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>

        Wrocław began as a Slavic settlement and grew under the Piast dynasty in the Middle Ages.

    <h2>Austrian & Prussian Influence</h2>
    <p>
        During the 18th and 19th centuries, Wrocław came under Austrian and later Prussian rule, which greatly influenced its architecture and development.

    <h2>World War II and Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>
        Much of the city was destroyed during World War II. After the war, Wrocław became part of Poland once again, and extensive rebuilding efforts brought it back to life.
